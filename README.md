- 👋 Hi, I’m @SankarRaghu
- 👀 I’m interested in working on topics that lie at the intersection of Applied Mathematics, Machine Learning, and AI. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms in the field of Stochastic Numerics and Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with applications in Quantitative Finance, Data Analytics, and Data Science.
- 🌱 I have received my doctoral degree in the field of *Applied Mathematics* from the **RWTH Aachen University, Germany**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing algorithms that are state-of-the-art in the fields of quantitative finance, stochastic numerics, and data science.
- 📫 You can reach me by my mail: ***sankarasubramanian.ragunathan@gmail.com***
- ⚡ Tech Stack: **C/C++**, **Python**, **PyTorch**, **MATLAB**, and **Julia**
